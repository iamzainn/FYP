----EDA UNIVARIATE :
RAM:
Distribution Type: Rather than a normal distribution, your RAM data shows a discrete multimodal distribution with strong peaks at 8GB (33%), 6GB (22%), and 12GB (21%). The positive skewness value (0.565) confirms it's right-skewed.
Outliers Interpretation: The 25.25% "potential outliers" reported by the boxplot are high because the IQR (interquartile range) is quite small (just 2GB). For discrete data like RAM sizes, standard outlier detection via IQR isn't always appropriate - these aren't necessarily errors but valid premium device configurations.
Equal 50th & 75th Percentiles: This doesn't indicate right skewness, but rather shows a plateau in the distribution - a large portion of phones (at least 25%) have exactly 8GB of RAM. This suggests 8GB was a standard configuration across many models.
Additional Key Insights
Distinct Market Segments: The distribution reveals clear market segmentation:
Budget segment (3-4GB): ~19.5% of devices
Mid-range segment (6-8GB): ~55% of devices
Premium segment (12-16GB): ~24% of devices
Evolution Indicator: The small percentage of 10GB RAM devices (0.11%) suggests this was not a standard configuration in the market.
Industry Standards: The high concentration around 8GB (33%) indicates this was an industry standard specification, likely representing the "sweet spot" for performance vs. cost.
Recommendations for Future Univariate Analysis
Compare with Launch Year: For RAM, examining how the distribution changes across years would reveal memory size evolution trends.
Consider Transformations: If you need to normalize this data for modeling, a log transformation might help with the right skew.
Segmentation Opportunity: These natural groupings in RAM could be used to create device category features (budget/mid/premium).
Missing Value Strategy: With no missing values in RAM, this could be a reliable feature for imputing other missing specifications.

Battery_mah:
Key Insights from Battery Capacity Distribution
Strong Industry Standardization: The extremely close median (5000 mAh) and 75th percentile (5050 mAh) reveal that 5000 mAh has become a strong industry standard for battery capacity.
Significant Right Skew: The high skewness (1.87) and kurtosis (4.96) confirm your observation about right skew and heavy tails - premium phones with ultra-high capacity batteries form a distinct segment.
Natural Battery Tiers: The distribution reveals three main battery capacity tiers:
Economy tier (~3200-4400 mAh): 25% of devices
Standard tier (~5000 mAh): Around 50% of devices cluster very tightly here
Premium tier (>6000 mAh): About 15-20% of devices, marketed as "long-lasting"
Missing Pattern Consideration: The 9.18% missing values should be examined for patterns (random or systematic) before imputation.
Imputation Strategy Recommendations
For this distribution, I recommend:

Median Imputation (5000 mAh): This is likely the best approach because:
The distribution has a strong central tendency at 5000 mAh
Mean (5024 mAh) is pulled higher by outliers
The median represents the most common battery capacity in the market
Conditional Imputation: Consider imputing based on:
Phone category (gaming phones tend to have larger batteries)
Year of release (newer phones generally have larger batteries)
Screen size (larger screens typically need bigger batteries)
Outlier Handling: The "outliers" (especially in the 7000-11000 mAh range) are valid data points representing power-focused devices. Consider:
Creating a "battery_capacity_category" feature rather than removing them
For modeling purposes, a log transformation could help normalize the distribution
This strong peak at 5000 mAh makes the data well-suited for median imputation, which will preserve the distribution's shape better than mean imputation would.

screen size:
Key Insights on Screen Size Distribution
Bimodal Distribution: What we're seeing is actually a bimodal distribution representing two distinct device categories:
Smartphones (5.0-7.0 inches): The dominant peak (~75% of devices)
Tablets/Phablets (8.0-14.6 inches): The right tail (~20-25% of devices)
Extremely Tight Standard Range: The remarkably small IQR (0.28) indicates strong standardization among smartphones, with most clustering very tightly around 6.5-6.8 inches.
Market Significance: This tight clustering reveals a strong consumer/manufacturer consensus on optimal smartphone screen size.
False "Outliers": The values labeled as outliers (17.61%) are not data errors but represent a legitimate second market segment (tablets). The boxplot method flags them due to the extremely narrow IQR.
Ideal Approach to Imputation and Outlier Handling
As an expert data scientist, your goal should NOT be to force normality or remove "outliers," but rather to:

Preserve Distribution Shape: The bimodal nature reflects real market segments; transforming to a normal distribution would destroy valuable information.
Segment-Aware Imputation:
For missing smartphone screen sizes: Impute with median of smartphone segment (6.67")
For missing tablet screen sizes: Impute with median of tablet segment (~10")
Feature Engineering over Removal:
Create a binary "device_type" feature (smartphone vs. tablet)
This preserves the information while addressing the distribution challenge
Transformation for Modeling:
If needed for specific algorithms, consider a binning approach or categorical transformation rather than outlier removal
Context-Aware Analysis: When analyzing correlations or building models, consider analyzing these segments separately or including interaction terms.
This approach preserves the meaningful information in your data's natural distribution while addressing the statistical challenges it presents. The goal isn't to force normality but to represent the underlying reality of your data while making it suitable for analysis


weight:
Extreme Device Type Separation: What we're seeing is another bimodal distribution, but with even more pronounced separation:
Standard smartphones (135-250g): ~85-90% of devices
Tablets/larger devices (400-732g): ~10-15% of devices
Remarkably Tight Smartphone Clustering: The extraordinarily small IQR (24g) shows incredible standardization in smartphone weight - 50% of all devices fall within just a 24-gram range!
Misleading Average: The mean (228.9g) falls in a "valley" between the two modes, making it a poor representation of either device category.
Sharp Boundary: Notice the major jump between the 75th percentile (209g) and 90th percentile (423.6g) - this clean separation indicates distinct product categories.
Recommendations for Mobile Weight Feature
Create Device Type Feature: Rather than treating as outliers, create a binary feature:
CopyInsert
df['device_type'] = df['Mobile Weight'].apply(lambda x: 'Tablet' if x > 300 else 'Smartphone')
Segment-Specific Analysis: When modeling price, consider:
Using device type as a categorical predictor
Creating separate models for smartphones vs. tablets
Including interaction terms (e.g., weight×device_type)
Weight Ratio Feature: Consider creating a "weight-to-screen-size ratio" feature - this will normalize the weight and provide insight into device density/quality.
For Visualization: Use logarithmic scales when plotting device weight to better show the full distribution.
This pattern of tight clustering in the smartphone category with a separate cluster for tablets is consistent across multiple features (weight, screen size). This strong segmentation will be important to acknowledge in your modeling approach.

Processor , front camera , back camera :

You're absolutely right that simple encoding won't work well here. The processor data has several key patterns:

Manufacturer Families: Clear groupings by chip maker:
Qualcomm Snapdragon (high-end, mid-range, budget tiers)
MediaTek (Dimensity, Helio G-series)
Apple A-series (flagship only)
Samsung Exynos
Hierarchical Structure: There's a clear performance hierarchy that should be preserved:
Generational improvements (Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 → Gen 2 → Gen 3)
Numerical tiers (800-series > 700-series > 600-series)
Recommended Approach:
Extract manufacturer (create processor_brand feature)
Extract generation/tier (create processor_tier feature with ordinal values)
Consider a benchmark-based mapping for true performance comparison
Missing Values: 9.84% missing - use device category, RAM, and year to guide imputation
Camera Analysis
Front Camera
The front camera shows clear market segmentation:

Budget tier: 5-8MP (25%)
Mid-range tier: 12-16MP (35%)
Premium tier: 32-50MP (26%)
Back Camera (91 unique values)
This reveals two critical dimensions:

Primary Camera Resolution: Clear clustering at 50MP, 48MP, 64MP, 108MP
Camera Count: From 1 to 4+ cameras (visible in the combinations)
Recommended Feature Engineering:

Create camera_count feature (already done)
Group primary camera MP into tiers (e.g., <12MP, 13-20MP, 48-50MP, >64MP)
Create a boolean feature for ultrawide presence (appears in many combinations)
Creating the Phone Category Feature
Based on all univariate analyses, I recommend a scoring system:

Budget: Lower RAM (3-4GB), single/dual camera, MediaTek Helio G-series/lower Snapdragon
Mid-range: Medium RAM (6GB), triple camera, mid-tier Snapdragon/Dimensity
Flagship: High RAM (8-12GB), premium processors (Snapdragon 8-series, A-series), quad camera
This approach will create meaningful market segments that align with manufacturer positioning and should significantly improve your price prediction models.

Back Camera Count Analysis - Market Evolution Insights
The Back Camera Count distribution provides excellent insights into smartphone market evolution and segmentation:

Key Insights
Market Transition Period: This distribution shows a market in transition from single-camera setups to multi-camera systems:
Single camera remains dominant (56.07%) but is clearly being phased out in newer devices
Almost half the market (43.93%) now has multi-camera setups
Clear Segmentation Indicator: Camera count serves as an excellent proxy for device tier:
Single camera (56.07%): Entry-level/budget and older devices
Dual camera (28.31%): Standard mid-range configuration
Triple camera (13.66%): Premium segment marker
Quad camera (1.97%): Ultra-premium/flagship exclusive feature
Right-Skewed Distribution: The positive skewness (1.03) indicates the market is moving toward more cameras, with quad-camera setups representing the cutting edge.
Perfect Categorical Feature: This is a natural ordinal categorical feature that doesn't require transformation - the count directly correlates with device positioning.
Market Implications
Marketing Differentiation: Camera count has become a key marketing feature that visually differentiates devices by tier (often prominently displayed in the design)
Feature Correlation: This will likely correlate strongly with:
Price (more cameras = higher price)
Processor tier (premium processors pair with multi-camera systems)
RAM (higher RAM devices tend to have more cameras)
Launch year (newer phones trend toward more cameras)
Feature Engineering Value
The camera_system classification I previously suggested would be particularly valuable here, as it:

Translates a numeric count into meaningful market positioning
Creates an intuitive feature for your phone category classification
Provides clear differentiation between market segments

Year:
Your dataset shows a clear recency bias in the phone records, which has important implications for your price prediction model:

Key Insights
Strong Recency Concentration:
67.65% of all devices in the dataset are from 2022-2024
2024 alone represents nearly one-third (31.80%) of all devices
Very few older devices (only 4.05% from 2014-2018)
Negative Skewness (-0.98):
Distribution is skewed toward recent years
Median (2023) is higher than mean (2022.21)
Low kurtosis (0.67) indicates a relatively flat peak
Data Relevance Advantage:
The dominance of recent models is actually advantageous for a price prediction task
Models trained on this data will be most accurate for current and near-future predictions
Feature Engineering Recommendations
This launch year distribution suggests several valuable approaches:

Device Age Feature:
python
CopyInsert
df['device_age'] = 2025 - df['Launched Year']
This creates a more intuitive feature that directly correlates with depreciation.
Generation Grouping:
python
CopyInsert
def phone_generation(year):
    if year <= 2018:
        return 'Legacy'
    elif year <= 2021:
        return 'Previous Generation'
    else:
        return 'Current Generation'
        
df['phone_generation'] = df['Launched Year'].apply(phone_generation)
Year-Adjusted Specifications:
What was "flagship" in 2019 might be "mid-range" in 2024
Consider creating relative specification scores within each year
Model Design Implications
Time-Based Interactions: Include interaction terms between year and specifications
Example: The value of 8GB RAM has decreased over time as it became standard
Year-Based Stratification: Consider separate models or stratified sampling by year groups for more accurate predictions
Trend Analysis Opportunity: The dataset spans enough years to potentially model specification evolution trends
The strong recency focus will help your model be more relevant for current pricing predictions while still having enough historical data to understand depreciation patterns
