i want to refactor somthing in setting.tsx 
right now margin top,bottom ,left right all are working fine but when i click on box it units is adding there which i donot want make it simpler remove extra functions at top just add drop down where user select unit px,rem,em,% just one at a time and this value dynamically added to `12${unit} there  and then this style is passing down properly to a valiadated function from where call is going handleOnChanges functon remove unnenecessary complex logic make things simpler and professional and make sure everything is working other no need to change anything else until i say, make sure typescript error are handle properly create interface of type unit having 'rem' , em , px ,% and default is px

Key Improvements
Type Safety:
Added a proper StyleUnit interface for type checking
Used proper TypeScript typing throughout
Simplified Unit Management:
Single dropdown for all margin controls and another for padding
Units are stored in React state and applied consistently
When input values change, unit is automatically appended
Cleaner Input Format:
Input fields now show only the numeric value (no unit)
Unit is dynamically added when updating the element
Regular expression strips units from display value
Removed Complex Functions:
Eliminated several helper functions for unit extraction/conversion
Simplified down to just handleStyleChange and handleIncrement
Cleaner Increment/Decrement:
Standardized behavior for +/- buttons
Unit is automatically maintained when incrementing/decrementing
This approach is much simpler while still maintaining all the functionality. The margin and padding sections now have a single unit selector each that applies to all sides, making the interface cleaner and more intuitive.
@Settings.tsx fix these red line errors and typescript issues too

good that properly what i wanted let add new propery section of flex direction control just below flex sections and align item just like justify content below just below justify content properly looking professional and working similarly using handleOnChnages no need to created extra component, make sure evereything is looking professionaly you can use any shad cn component to build this
also update flex section too make it too professional icon on clicking to it everything should be workable.
write effienct clean typesafe code and make sure if you stuck read other component way and then write code accordingly so that you have idea how to handle things no need to do anything extra

# Adding Flex Direction and Align Items to Settings
I'll add professional flex direction and align items controls to the Flexbox section, using the shadcn/ui Tabs component similar to what you've done for justify-content.

Key Improvements
Added Flex Direction Control:
Implemented with visual icons for row, column, row-reverse, column-reverse
Used Tabs component for consistent UI with other controls
Added helpful tooltips for better usability
Added Align Items Control:
Provides options for flex-start, center, flex-end, stretch, baseline
Visually represented with appropriate vertical alignment icons
Matches the style of the justify-content control
Improved Justify Content:
Updated value names to CSS standard "flex-start", "flex-end" instead of just "start", "end"
Added tooltips for better usability
Improved layout with consistent spacing
Added Gap Control:
New control for adjusting space between flex items
Includes increment/decrement buttons
Unit selection for px, rem, em, %
Better Section Organization:
Increased gap between controls for better visual separation
Consistent styling across all flex controls
Clear labeling for each property
These additions give your users complete control over flexbox layouts while maintaining the professional, clean styling of your existing settings panel.
yes these settings are perfectly working well what i wanted but when i applied this on 2colCompionent function is calling perfectly but i think due to useeffect inside of @TwoColComponent.tsx its get overridden lead to not exactly update css accordingly 
so how to fix this i want that it can be updated via setting.tsx accordingly but also when screen size get shringk it become flex-direction to column how to do this just do this make sure write clean and approatie code no need to do anything else make sure only update these kind of setting

# Fixing the Conflict Between Settings.tsx and TwoColComponent.tsx
The issue is that there's a conflict between the manual flex-direction control in the Settings panel and the automatic responsive behavior in the TwoColComponent. Let's fix the TwoColComponent to respect manual changes while still maintaining responsive behavior.
42 hidden lines
Now let's also update the handleChangeCustomValues function in Settings.tsx to mark when a user has manually set a style for the current device:
This implementation provides a solution that:
Adds a tracking mechanism to know when styles are manually set for specific devices
Prevents automatic responsive behavior from overriding manual settings
Maintains the responsive behavior when no manual settings are present
Only triggers responsive updates when the device actually changes
The key improvement is that we're adding device-specific flags to track which properties have been manually set, and we're only depending on the device state in the useEffect, not on the whole element or content.
no what i wanted is that when device is changing it syle also changed to flex-direction to col other wise no need to do anything else , if user manually change via setting.tsx (flex direction) it should changed despite of any screen size as other component also changes accordingly
just do this also there is not exist of deviceSpecificStyles so remove it from both of component .tsx accordingly just listen for if device changes it update it style other wise the default style shpould be working manulaly

Thought Process
# Simplified Solution for TwoColComponent Responsiveness
I'll implement a cleaner approach that automatically handles device changes while respecting manual style settings. Let's simplify both components:
This simpler approach:
Automatically updates flex-direction based on device size (column for Mobile, row for other devices)
Respects manual user settings by checking if they've set a non-standard flex direction (row-reverse/column-reverse)
Only updates styles when the device actually changes
Doesn't need any additional tracking mechanism
The key insight is that we can detect manual settings by looking for non-standard flex directions. When a user explicitly selects a specific value in the Settings panel, like row-reverse or column-reverse, the component will respect that choice and won't auto-update.
With this approach:
If the user hasn't modified the flex direction, it will automatically switch between row and column based on device
If the user manually sets any flex direction value through the Settings panel, that value will be preserved
This solution is simpler while still meeting your requirements for both automatic responsiveness and manual control.
yes its work properly so far today what problem we faced and what solution you fined explain in new.txt file with details each point also explain complete procedure of how to build compound component properly according to my files , code ,architecture and what things to keep in mind in order to build one proper compound component in future with ease. accotding to my project code ,architecture. make sure use simple and plain english as you taught someone about it , explain step by step

Compound Component Building Guide for Website Builder
Today's Problem and Solution
Problem:
The TwoColComponent had a conflict between Settings.tsx manual controls and its internal responsive behavior.
When device size changed, the component would automatically change its flex-direction to row/column.
If a user manually set flex-direction through Settings.tsx, this would get overridden when the device changed.
This created confusion as manual style changes weren't persisting across device changes.
Solution:
We modified the TwoColComponent to detect manually set values by looking for non-standard flex directions.
When row-reverse or column-reverse are detected, we assume these were manually set by the user.
The automatic responsive behavior only runs if standard values (row/column) are present.
This preserves user customization while maintaining automatic responsive behavior by default.
We also simplified the dependency array to only trigger on device changes, not on every render.
How to Build Compound Components in this Project
Step 1: Plan Your Component Structure
Decide what atomic elements your compound component will contain
Determine the default styles and layout (flex, grid, etc.)
Plan for responsive behavior across different devices
Step 2: Create the Component File
Create a new file in src/components/editor/BUILDER/YourComponentName.tsx
Start with the standard imports and interface:
Step 3: Implement Basic Component Structure
Set up the main component function that accepts the element prop
Extract important properties from the element
Set up the editor hooks for state and actions:
Step 4: Implement Event Handlers
Add standard handlers for clicks, drags, and drops:
Step 5: Implement Responsive Behavior
Use useEffect to handle device changes and adjust styles:
Step 6: Create Component JSX
Build the component's markup with proper classes and styles:
Step 7: Register the Component
Add the component to the BUILDER_COMPONENTS map in the editor provider
Create a default structure for the component in constants.ts
Step 8: Add Component Button
Create a button/component for the sidebar that allows users to drag and drop the component
Important Things to Remember:
Balance Between Automation and User Control: Always provide a way for user settings to override automatic behavior
Handle Responsiveness: Make components responsive by default, but respect user customizations
Child Elements: Manage child elements properly, ensuring their styles update in relation to parent changes
Performance: Use focused useEffects with specific dependency arrays to prevent unnecessary re-renders
Type Safety: Use proper TypeScript typing to catch errors early
Consistent Styles: Follow the project's style patterns (borders, selection indicators, etc.)
User Feedback: Show proper selection indicators and component labels
By following these steps and principles, you can create consistent compound components that fit perfectly within the project's architecture while maintaining both automatic responsive behavior and respecting manual user customizations.
