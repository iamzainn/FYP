Store Editor Implementation Summary
Here's a step-by-step summary of what we've accomplished so far in building the web store editor:

1. Editor Context & State Management
- Created an EditorProvider (/src/providers/editor/editor-provider.tsx) to manage the global state of the editor
- Implemented state types including EditorElement, Editor, and EditorState
- Added support for content properties like href, src, and innerText
- Implemented action types for various editor operations (ADD, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.)
- Set up the reducer for handling editor actions and maintaining history state

2. Editor Navigation Component
- Created EditorNavigation component to provide controls for switching between editing modes
- Implemented device selection (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile)
- Added preview and live mode toggles

3. Editor Sidebar
- Created EditorSidebar to house editing tools and element options
- Implemented SideBarItems component to display different tabs based on selection
- Added SettingsTab for editing element properties (href, color, etc.)
- Integrated MediaTab for displaying and selecting media from the store
- Removed showX property to fix rendering issues in SheetContent components

4. Main Editor Component
- Created the main Editor component (/src/components/editor/Editor.tsx) as the primary workspace
- Implemented data fetching with useEffect to load page content
- Added responsive handling for different device sizes
- Implemented click handling to select and display elements
- Added UI elements for preview/live mode toggle
- Added debugging tools to help identify rendering issues

5. Element Building System
- Created a BUILDER folder structure for element components
- Implemented the Recursive component (/src/components/editor/BUILDER/recursive.tsx) to handle rendering different element types
- Added TextComponent with the following functionality:
  - Interactive editing via contentEditable
  - Visual indicators for selected elements
  - Element deletion with Trash icon
  - Content updating through dispatch actions
  - Element selection via click events
  - Style application from the element's style property
- Added VideoComponent with the following features:
  - Embedding capability for YouTube videos
  - Conditional rendering to handle different content types
  - Selection UI with badges
  - Drag-and-drop functionality
- Enhanced Container component with:
  - Visual feedback when selected (yellow border)
  - Badges showing element name when selected
  - Type-specific styling for different container types
  - Logic for adding various element types via drag-and-drop

6. Element Editing Capabilities
- Implemented UPDATE_ELEMENT action to update element content
- Added DELETE_ELEMENT action to remove elements
- Created CHANGE_CLICKED_ELEMENT action to handle element selection
- Fixed type checking in the Settings component for link elements
- Updated type handling in VideoComponent to safely render content

7. Editor Page Structure
- Updated the main editor page (/app/site/[userId]/stores/[storeId]/[storePageId]/editor/page.tsx)
- Integrated all components within the EditorProvider context
- Set up the page layout with navigation, sidebar, and editor workspace
- Restructured to match design requirements with fixed positioning and proper z-index

8. Debugging and Fixes
- Added console logging for tracking component rendering and state
- Fixed conditional rendering issues in VideoComponent
- Added visual feedback to Container to make selection state visible
- Fixed type handling for content arrays vs. objects
- Redesigned layout structure to better match requirements
- Added conditional styling for highlighting selected elements

Current State
The editor now has the core infrastructure for:
- Selecting and displaying elements
- Editing text content
- Adding video elements
- Deleting elements
- Switching between different view modes
- Responsive design preview
- Drag and drop functionality for adding elements to containers

The next steps would be to:
- Add more element types beyond text and video (images, buttons, etc.)
- Enhance drag and drop capabilities
- Add more advanced editing capabilities
- Improve the element styling and properties panel
- Implement save/publish functionality
- Add undo/redo functionality leveraging the history state

This summary captures the main components and functionality implemented so far in the store editor project
